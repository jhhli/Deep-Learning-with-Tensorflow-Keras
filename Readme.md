# Some Thoughts in Deep Learning venv and libraries using tensorflow framework

## TensorFlow is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:

### Python 3.5â€“3.8
### Ubuntu 16.04 or later
### Windows 7 or later (with C++ redistributable)
### macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or later (no GPU support)
### Raspbian 9.0 or later

## Install libraries as requirments.txt in the venv

pip install numpy==1.19.3 (1.19.4 will not work with Windows 2004)

pip install tf-nightly, pandas, matplotlib, keras

## If you want to use Intel or AMD graphic cards to accelerate the training, plaindML is recommanded. 

### plaindML Windows installation

#### 1 First install Chocolatey by starting an Administrator PowerShell and running:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

#### 2 Install Python:

choco install -y python git vcredist2015

#### 3 Switch to an unprivileged PowerShell to install and set up PlaidML with Keras

pip install -U plaidml-keras
plaidml-setup

#### 4 PlaidML should now be installed! You can test the installation by running MobileNet in plaidbench.

pip install plaidml-keras plaidbench
plaidbench keras mobilenet

## If you want to use NVIDIA graphic cards to accelerate the training, install cuda ... will update later
